As you set out to learn how to be a backend developer it is common, and very normal, to get stuck on a concept or assignment. Don't feel discouraged! remember that learning to code isn't easy, but the journey is worth it! As we say here at Boot.dev learning to code is a marathon, not a sprint. Take your time to break problems and concepts down, and try your best to really understand whats happening before moving on to the next assignment. Even after breaking down a problem as best you can, you may still find that you are confused or stuck - Don't fear, you are never learning alone here at Boot.dev.

## Who is Boots?

Boots is a whimsical, artificially intelligent bear. He is designed to help users understand and dissect the complex world of backend development. Much like a friendly mentor, Boots will patiently walk you through code snippets, revealing the magic behind each line and method. Learn more about boots, including his origin story: [here](https://blog.boot.dev/news/introducing-boots-ai-code-explainer/).

Learning to code, especially backend development, can sometimes feel like trying to learn a form of arcane magic. Boots turns this complex process into a more enjoyable and comprehensible journey. His primary role is to explain the inner workings of code, breaking it down into simpler components that are easier to understand.

Boots, being an AI, is available round the clock, ready to assist whenever you're stuck on a specific part of your assignment.

However, it's important to note that Boots does not replace the need for dedicated study, collaboration, and perseverance. He's a tool to aid learning, not a substitute for the learning process itself. He's also not perfect. Getting help from the Boot.dev instructors, other students, and community members in the [boot.dev community](https://boot.dev/community) is your best best when you are truly stuck.

# What is the best way to use Boots?

The best way to use Boots is as a supportive tool in your learning journey. While Boots can dissect and explain any code snippet, he won't always be able to understand the full context or outcome of your problem just from a small snippet. Therefore, it's essential to use him for clarifying doubts, but not rely on him to provide a comprehensive review of your entire assignment.

Also, remember that coding rules are dynamic and context-dependent. While Boots' guidance can be tremendously helpful, you need to apply his advice on a case-by-case basis, using your judgment and understanding of the overall assignment.

# How to contact Boots

To make use of Boots' wizardly knowledge, follow these simple steps:

1. Highlight the snippet in the code editor of code you want Boots to explain.
2. Press the 'Explain' button located at the bottom of the assignment markdown.

Boots will then review the selected code and provide an explanation of its inner workings to the best of his ability. 

Remember, Boots advice isn't *free* contacting him will reduce the amount of XP you will be awarded on that specific assignment by 25%, not as much as viewing the solution, but also an incentive to try your best to solve the challenge on your own first!
