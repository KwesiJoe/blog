Hope you had a wonderful holiday! I know you might not have been able to take time off, but I hope you were able to spend *some* time with family and friends. I spent the whole week driving up and down the state of Utah. It was fun, but I'm happy to be back in my office. Kids can be exhausting. Love 'em, but they're exhausting.

Regards, Lane

## Patch notes

### 1. New Course: Learn Shells and Terminals

Using a terminal is an invaluable skill for any developer, but it's also often overlooked. When I got my CS degree, I had to teach myself how to navigate the command line, and I wish I had a course that would have taken me through all the fundamentals. That's what this new course, [Learn Shells and Terminals](https://www.boot.dev/learn/learn-shells-and-terminals) is all about. No need for you to suffer!

### 2. Lore

["The March of Time"](https://www.boot.dev/lore) is an online novel that we're publishing chapter by chapter on Boot.dev. It's the lore of Boots' universe, and we hope you'll enjoy it. It's not required reading by any means, but if you enjoy the legendarium we're building to keep learning fun, you might want to check it out.

### 3. Boots works the same in all lesson types

Boots used to only be available on multiple choice lessons *after* completing the assignment, and he wasn't available on all lesson types. We've now made Boots available on all lesson types, and he works the same way in all of them.

### 4. Fellowship Achievements

Our [Discord community](https://boot.dev/community) is easily one of our most valuable features for students. We already had amazing senior developers and students in there helping out beginners, but we wanted to reward them for their efforts. We've added a new "Fellowship" achievement type that you can earn by helping out other students in the community.

## What is yet to come

* More videos for the new "Shells and Terminals" course
* More videos for the "Learn to Get a Coding Job" course
* A global survey for everyone learning to code
* Challenges and reworking of the "Learn JavaScript" course
* More lore
* Boss battles (I'll say no more at this time)
* Course on memory management
* Course on Git

### [(Podcast) Consider this before migrating the Backend to HTTP/3](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/consider-this-before-migrating-the-backend-to-http-3/id1330350799?i=1000630346842)

by Hussein Nasser

Hussein is the host of the Backend Engineering Podcast! He does a great job tackling deeply technical projects in each episode, usually by himself. HTTP 2 and 3 are fascinating, and there is a lot of confusion around them. Hussein does a great job explaining some of the things you should consider before migrating to HTTP 3.

### [(Article) Grapheme Clusters and Terminal Emulators](https://mitchellh.com/writing/grapheme-clusters-in-terminals)

by Mitchell Hashimoto

Mitchell is a co-founder of one of the companies I admire most: Hashicorp. They make some of the best developer tools out there, including Terraform. He also blogs on his site, and I found this piece about terminal emulators particularly interesting. I've been using the terminal for as long as I've been a developer, and I had no idea about some of the intricacies he talks about.

### [(Article) Rook to XSS: How I hacked chess.com with a rookie exploit](https://skii.dev/rook-to-xss/)

by Jacob

Jacob (unsure of his last name) wrote an amazing article about how he hacked chess.com. It's a great read about web security and I was further amazed to learn that he's only 17 years old!
