*Even though development skills are highly sought-tafter these days, actually learning coding can be intimidating and time-consuming for many newcomers.*

With the demand for digital solutions like antivirus software, browsers or password managers increasing exponentially, the field of development has become increasingly competitive. As the world shifts to a more digital-centric lifestyle, developers are expected to keep up with the rapid changes in technology and trends.

To find out more about how Boot.dev is helping developers stay on top of their game and how the platform can equip beginners to become more confident and successful, we interviewed Lane Wagner, the Founder and CEO of Boot.dev

## Q: What has the journey been like for Boot.dev? How did it all start?

I wrote the first line of code for Boot.dev as the pandemic broke out in March 2020. I was employed full-time at the time as an engineering manager, and Boot.dev (or as it was known at the time, Qvault.io) was a creative outlet where I was able to publish courses and blogs about software development.

I worked solo on the project for a couple of years. 2022 was finally the year that the project took off. I hired my first employee at the tail end of 2021, and we grew from about $1k monthly revenue from that point until July of 2022 when I raised a bit of seed funding from some angel investors that I knew personally from a past job. That money allowed me and my employee to both go full-time on Boot.dev in August of 2022, and we’ve been growing quickly ever since.

## Q: Can you introduce us to what you do? What makes boot.dev different from other coding boot camps?

The name “Boot.dev is a bit tongue-in-cheek – we’re not really a boot camp. Boot.dev is a self-paced online learning platform for back-end developers. We’re unique in a few ways:

We focus on back-end skills and technologies. The vast majority of online resources focus on the front end, even though there are almost twice as many back-end developers in the world as front-end developers.
An addicting learning experience. Our courses have a fantasy/RPG feel to them, with students unlocking achievements and roles as they level up by learning new concepts.
Our commitment to building. Passively learning by reading and watching videos is not enough. Our students write code with every new concept they learn, and they immediately apply it to a real-world scenario.
What would you consider the main challenges developers run into nowadays?

Confusion is a big one: not knowing where to start or what to learn. If you’re surfing around on YouTube and Twitter it can be really easy to fall prey to “shiny new tech” syndrome. You don’t need to learn all the latest hyped-up technologies to get your first job!

The most successful students are the ones who can settle on a goal, and make deep and consistent progress toward that goal. That’s why at Boot.dev we’re so laser-focused on modern back-end development skills. We only teach skills and technologies that move you closer to that goal.

## Q: In your opinion, what are some of the biggest mistakes teachers and institutions make when it comes to online learning?

In regard to traditional education (think college and university), the biggest mistake is teaching too much tangential material. I love philosophy and humanities as much as the next guy, I actually read and listen to quite a few philosophy podcasts. However, when students are struggling to make ends meet, it’s not the time to distract them with material unrelated to their career goals.

In regard to Bootcamps, the biggest mistake is moving students too quickly through a bunch of fancy technologies. With a tech recession in full swing, and the prevalence of 12-week boot camps abounding, I think the best way to differentiate yourself in the job market is to take the time to learn more thoroughly. That means understanding more of the fundamentals, going deeper into the subject matter, and ruthlessly figuring out how it applies to your future career by building real projects.

## Q: What are the best practices companies should follow when developing applications?

This question is probably too broad for this kind of interview format, but a couple of common mistakes I’ve observed are building too much from scratch and technology/vendor lock-in.

These might sound like conflicting problems, and to an extent they are, but balancing these two issues properly is the best way to move fast. Ideally, you’re able to use as many off-the-shelf solutions as you can to get started, sort of gluing them together to build your unique solution. However, it’s best if you can also make the architecture of your application modular to an extent so that it’s easy to swap out bits that aren’t working, or, as you scale up, that you want to bring in-house for further customization.

## Q: Talking about personal cybersecurity, what security tools or practices do you think everyone should adopt to protect themselves online?

The tools for protecting yourself have come a long way since the early 2000’s when I was first spending time online. As long as you don’t go around explicitly removing guardrails you’re in pretty good shape if you’re on the latest Windows, Mac, Android, or iOS operating system. Linux is great, but of course, you’re taking more control of your own security, and need to be prepared to do it.

I think my shortlist would simply be:

Never reuse passwords, use a password manager
Stay away from non-https sites
Don’t bypass security warnings from your OS or browser unless you’re absolutely sure you know what you’re doing
What tips would you give to someone looking to learn back-end development?

Check out Boot.dev! We have a full learning path that you can follow for less than the price of a gym membership. Aside from plugging my own resources though, another important thing to keep in mind is that your local job market will have a unique tech stack skew. I’d recommend doing some research into what technologies companies around you are using, or maybe the companies that you would enjoy working remotely for, and make sure you learn those as well.

I’m a big believer in the idea that the technologies you’re familiar with don’t define your worth as a developer. Sure, I teach Python, Go, and JavaScript because I think they’re widely useful to your future career, but that doesn’t mean that after learning the fundamentals of back-end development in Go you can’t spend a couple of weeks applying what you know to learn the syntax and conventions of Ruby on Rail. 90& of the knowledge is transferable.

## Q: What advancements and innovations in the software development field do you hope to see in the near future?

Like the rest of the world, I’m eagerly watching the advancements of LLMs and AI in general. I’m fascinated by how much more efficient and effective we can become as engineers with these new tools in our toolbelts. I also love to see what’s happening with languages like Go, Rust, and TypeScript.

I think static typing and developer tooling is just going to keep getting better and better and understanding how to leverage those advantages will give many engineers an edge over the rest who are taking a more manual approach.

## Q: And finally, what’s next for Boot.dev?

We’re still focused on adding more back-end related courses and projects to the platform, and we’re also spending a significant amount of our time working on the game loop of the platform. I genuinely feel that learning to code should be so much more fun than it is for many students currently, and we’re working to provide that addicting experience that makes it easiest for learners to hit their goals.

That said, I think at some point in the next year or two we’ll be looking into how we can provide additional resources for students who want to get into data engineering. For many companies, the responsibilities of data engineers and back-end developers overlap a lot, and an additional skill set makes you that much more valuable in the job market.
