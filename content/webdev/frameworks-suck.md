There is only one question that ignites my inner range more than "xxx"?

> What framework should I use?

It's not that I think frameworks are evil, scary, or even bad. I just hate the *assumption* that to build an online thing, you just *gotta* start with a framework.

## What is a Web Framework?

The JavaScript ecosystem has had its way with the definition of the term "web framework". The JS community seems to excel at keeping us from having nice things.

I like to define the terms "library" and "framework" as follows:

* **Library**: Code that you import into your project.
* **Framework**: A structure that you import your code into.

A framework provides nearly as much project lock-in as a programming language. If I choose to build my application in Ruby on Rails, it's impossible to move to Python Django without a full rewrite.

A library is hot-swappable. If I use a library for database access, and a new one comes out that seems to do a better job, only a small part of my application needs to be updated.

**Hey Next.js devs, React is a framework.** Neither Dan Abramov nor God himself can convince me that React is just a library. I understand that it can kinda be used as one, but no one does that.

And while we're at it, Express.js isn't a framework. It's just a routing library.

## It's a matter of defaults



## Don't stop thinking
