Theo made a video about Kubernetes like, forever ago, and I kept meaning to respond to it, but I didn't. Until now.

The video is [here: "You Don't Need Kubernetes"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5sPGruv2yc).

I think Theo is unilaterally correct if you fall into a specific category of developer. That is, I think he's correct if you're a developer building at a small company (maybe your own) and you're not already good at Kubernetes.

Now, to be clear, Theo does provide a lot of nuance about cases where K8s is useful in his video, and he's right about his caveats. But the 95% of the video I agree with doesn't make for an interesting read, so let's dive into the 5% I disagree with.

## Kubernetes is hard

Not really, and not so much anymore.

## Websockets through a third-party

## I've invested hundreds of dollars in k8s infrastructure (not hundreds of thousands)

## The cost of engineers who know how to use K8s is high

Just be The Primeagen.

## Startups using k8s move slower

For me, it's not about everything being on my VPS. I don't have everything on my VPS. But for me, k8s is simpler than third parties.
