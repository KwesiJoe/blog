Theo made a video about Kubernetes like, forever ago, and I kept meaning to respond to it, but I didn't. Until now. The video is [here: "You Don't Need Kubernetes"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5sPGruv2yc). It's a great watch, especially if you're an indie developer or building an internet startup.

*But.*

If you're trying to build a successful career as a software engineer, I think there is a less obvious lesson to be learned hidden between the frames: if you want to be an *expensive* engineer, maybe you should be learning (things like) Kubernetes.

It's common knowledge that if you're starting a business, you don't want to be doing the thing that everyone else is doing. When you come up with a killer app idea, and you pitch it to your friends, inevitably the first thing out of their.

## Kubernetes is hard

Not really, and not so much anymore.

## Websockets through a third-party

## I've invested hundreds of dollars in k8s infrastructure (not hundreds of thousands)

## The cost of engineers who know how to use K8s is high

Just be The Primeagen.

## Startups using k8s move slower

For me, it's not about everything being on my VPS. I don't have everything on my VPS. But for me, k8s is simpler than third parties.
