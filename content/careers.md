We're building the smartest way to master backend development by tackling the hardest problem with e-learning: boredom.  We're a small team of developers who love to make the process of learning as fun and hands-on as it can be.

## Open positions

### Video Producer | Full-time | Remote

We're looking for an in-house video producer to:

* Make our video podcast look and sound amazing
* Edit and produce explainer videos for our courses
* Edit and produce any other videos we need for marketing and content
* Be involved and help with the creative process of planning and executing videos
* Manage all organic social media
* Plan and execute a strategy to get our organic content in front of more folks, mostly on social
* Manage any outside contractors we need to make our projects go off
* (it's a lot, but startups amirite)

Ideally, you'll be able to do *most* of what we need yourself, and only hire out for the stuff that:

1. Is outside your skillset
2. You don't have time to do given the workload

**Stuff we like to see:**

* Experience making engaging videos
* Animations and effects
* Social media prowess
* Thumbnail badassery
* Audio leveling wizardry
* Good effing taste

**Compensation:**

* $50,000-$65,000 USD per year
* Health benefits
* Unlimited PTO
* Yearly team retreat (probably)
* Coding education provided (forced)
* Options equity

**How to apply:**

Send an email to `lane at boot .dev` with:

* Your resume
* Links to some of the creative work you've done
* A personal note about why you're interested in working with us

## Our tech stack

* Backend: Go, Docker, k8s, Postgres, GCP, Pub/Sub
* Frontend: Nuxt/Vue 3, TypeScript, Tailwind, Pinia, Vite, Vercel
* Blog: Hugo, Tailwind, Vercel, Git

## Who you are

We don't know you yet, but if you're going to enjoy working with us, you'll probably have some of the following traits:

* You love to teach and share your knowledge with others
* You like to hang out in Discord
* You enjoy working remotely most of the time
* You like to build with the latest technologies and aren't afraid to learn new things
* You get stuff done when no one is looking
* You relentlessly ship projects that you're proud of
* You're a good writer and can explain complex topics in simple terms
* You love video games. Bonus points for DotA, Starcraft, World of Warcraft or Age of Empires
* You love a good fantasy story. Bonus points for Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, and The Stormlight Archive

## Other stuff to know

* We've grown roughly 10x in 2023
* Boot.dev was originally a side project, but we're now a full-time team of 3.
* We raised $330,000 dollars from an angel investor, but are now profitable and have a nice buffer of cash in the bank.
* We don't have plans to raise more money. We want to grow responsibly and build a sustainable business that provides value to our students.
* We like to play. We play video games, magic the gathering, eat together when possible and even take trips together when we hit our goals.
* We don't have plans to quickly sell the company or go public. It could happen, but it's more likely that we'll distribute profits to the team and investors.
