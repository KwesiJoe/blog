We're building the smartest way to master backend development by tackling the hardest problem with e-learning: boredom.  We're a small team of developers who love to make the process of learning as fun and hands-on as it can be.

## Open positions

### Digital Marketer #1

* Location: Remote possible, Salt Lake Area preferred
* Reports to: Founder
* Compensation: Salary + Equity DOE

Junior? Senior? Whatever. We just want someone that can do a great job helping new learners find Boot.dev. We need someone with the following skills in descending order of importance:

* **Writing & Copywriting**: Can you tell a good story? Can you grab someone's attention and keep it? Can you write in a way that's easy to understand?
* **Creative**: Can you make things look good? Can you script an engaging YouTube video? Can you point out what's wrong with a TikTok video?
* **Code & tech**: Can you write a simple script in Python? Do you know how to use Git?
* **SEO**: Do you know how to audit a website for SEO issues? Do you know how to optimize the content to rank? Do you know how to build backlinks?
* **Analytics**: Do you know how to setup and manage Google Analytics, MixPanel, Posthog, etc? Do you know which metrics are important?
* **Paid campaigns**: Do you know how to setup and manage Google Ads, Facebook Ads, etc? Do you know how to get creative in order to find a positive ROAS?

*You don't need to be an expert in all of these areas, but we need someone that can do well and learn quickly.*

You'll be the first full-time marketing hire, so you'll have a lot of freedom to experiment and try new things. We have budget to try new things, but we need someone that can be responsible with the money and find profitable channels quickly. We plan to stay profitable.

We need someone who understands our core audience. We're not looking for someone that can market a weight loss product on Facebook. We're looking for someone who deeply understands the pain points of aspiring developers and can help them find Boot.dev in places they already hang out.

**How to apply:**

Send an email to `lane at boot .dev` with:

* Your resume
* Links to some of the creative work you've done
* A personal note about why you're interested in working with us

* Frontend: Nuxt/Vue 3, TypeScript, Tailwind, Pinia, Vite, Vercel
* Blog: Hugo, Tailwind, Vercel, Git

## Who you are

We don't know you yet, but if you're going to enjoy working with us, you'll probably have some of the following traits:

* You love to teach and share your knowledge with others
* You like to hang out in Discord
* You enjoy working remotely most of the time
* You like to build with the latest technologies and aren't afraid to learn new things
* You get stuff done when no one is looking
* You relentlessly ship projects that you're proud of
* You're a good writer and can explain complex topics in simple terms
* You love video games. Bonus points for DotA, Starcraft, World of Warcraft or Age of Empires
* You love a good fantasy story. Bonus points for Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, and The Stormlight Archive

## Other stuff to know

* We've grown roughly 10x in 2023
* Boot.dev was originally a side project, but we're now a full-time team of 3.
* We raised $330,000 dollars from an angel investor, but are now profitable and have a nice buffer of cash in the bank.
* We don't have plans to raise more money. We want to grow responsibly and build a sustainable business that provides value to our students.
* We like to play. We play video games, magic the gathering, eat together when possible and even take trips together when we hit our goals.
* We don't have plans to quickly sell the company or go public. It could happen, but it's more likely that we'll distribute profits to the team and investors.
