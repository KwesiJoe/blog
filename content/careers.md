## Who you are

We don't know you yet, but if you're going to enjoy working with us, you'll probably have some of the following traits:

* You're a skilled developer who loves to teach and share your knowledge with others
* You like to hang out in Discord and chat with other developers
* You enjoy working remotely most of the time
* You like to build with the latest technologies and aren't afraid to learn new things
* You get stuff done when no one is looking
* You relentlessly ship code that you're proud of
* You're a good writer and can explain complex topics in simple terms
* You love video games. Bonus points for DotA, Starcraft, World of Warcraft and Age of Empires

## Open positions

*Sorry, we don't have any openings at the moment!*

## How to apply

If you're interested in any of the positions listed above, please send an email to `hello at boot .dev` with your resume and a personal note about why you're interested in working with us.

## Other stuff to know

* Boot.dev was originally a side project, but we're now a full-time team of 2. We're looking for the 3rd member of our team.
* We raised $330,000 dollars from an angel investor, but are now profitable.
* Most of that money is still in the bank and we don't have plans to raise more money. We want to grow responsibly and build a sustainable business that provides value to our students.
* We like to play. We play video games, magic the gathering, eat together when possible and even take trips together when we hit our goals.
* We don't have plans to quickly sell the company or go public. It could happen, but it's more likely that we'll distribute profits to the team and investors.
