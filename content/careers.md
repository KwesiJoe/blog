## Open positions

If you're interested in any of the following positions, please send an email to `hello at boot .dev` with your resume and a personal note about why you're interested in working with us.

### Senior Software Engineer

* **Location**: Remote USA. Bonus points for SLC, UT
* **Experience**: Number of years isn't too important, but *most* developers will take 5-10 years of professional experience to reach the "senior" level we're looking for

We're looking for the 3rd member of our team! In descending order of importance, your responsibilities will include:

* Build the Boot.dev learning platform.
  * This includes the backend API, frontend, and blog.
  * We aren't satisfied with simply publishing text+video tutorials.
  * We're constantly looking to improve the learning experience with tight feedback loops, gamification, and better solution verification.
* Maintain and improve existing Boot.dev courses and projects.
  * We spend more time improving existing courses than we do creating new ones.
  * Quality is more important than quantity when it comes to our learning material.
* Write new courses and projects, and build new features for the platform to support them.
  * We have a long backlog of courses and projects that we want to create.
  * You should be comfortable creating a course outline, then building the course from start to finish (of course we'll help)
* Design the product experience
  * You don't need to be the best designer in the world, but you should be able to create a good user experience
  * We're a small team, so we need our developers to be able to design and implement their own features
* Be a community leader
  * Our Discord community is growing quickly and we need more people helping to keep it a fun and safe place to learn.
  * Answer questions, help people debug their code, and share your knowledge with others
* Help us grow
  * We're a small team and we need everyone to help us grow
  * This could be blogging, creating videos, going on podcasts, or streaming on Twitch
  * We're in the process of growing a YouTube channel and podcast

## Other stuff to know

* Boot.dev was originally a side project, but we're now a full-time team of 2. We're looking for the 3rd member of our team.
* We raised $330,000 dollars from an angel investor, but are now profitable.
* Most of that money is still in the bank and we don't have plans to raise more money. We want to grow responsibly and build a sustainable business that provides value to our students.
* We like to play. We play video games, magic the gathering, eat together when possible and even take trips together when we hit our goals.
* We don't have plans to quickly sell the company or go public. It could happen, but it's more likely that we'll distribute profits to the team and investors.
